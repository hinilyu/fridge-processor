# Fridge Processor 
This is the final project of the course [CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/).

Have it ever occured to you that there are leftovers in the fridge that you don't know how to deal with but you need to cook them ASAP before it expires? Fridge processor is a web application that allow users to search for recipes using specific ingredients that are left in their fridge. It runs on Django in the backend and handles frontend interaction with Javascript.

There are 3 major functions in the webpage.
  - `Search` - The main page of the app. It shows a interacted fridge that the user can add ingredients to. First, user will type the name of the ingredients in the search box. Then a list of ingredients matching the input will show in a drop-down box. User then can add them into the fridge using the "Add" button. Lastly, when all desired ingredients are added, user can click the "Get Recipes" button to get the result.
  - `Result` - This page return a list of 20 recipes from the user's input ingredients. When you click the recipe thumbnail, each result is loaded with the name of the recipe along with a thumbnail image and list of ingredients. Each recipe provides a hyperlink to the original recipe on external websites.
  - `Saved Recipe` - On the result page, user can click the "Favortie" button to save a recipe. User can later recall their favourtie recipes from the Saved Recipe page.

The fridge accepts up to 9 user inputs and then verify with our ingredients database, which only allow limited ingredients right now because of the limited number of food illustrations. Then the parameter would pass through to Edamam's API to search for recipes that contain user's input ingredients. Data are shown or each recipes: Name, type of meal, cook duration, calories, ingredients list and external link to the recipe. User can also save their favourite recipes when they are logged in.

# Distinctiveness and Complexity
This application is a recipe search engine with ability to bookmark favourite recipes for users. There are several distinct function implemented in the app. First, there's a interactive fridge that you can add or remove ingredients from. Secondly, the result page is different from what you can get from a Google Search, it provides more specific information like preparation time and calories. It's not related to social media page nor e-commerce store. It's not similiar to other cs50's project too.

In the complexity part, Angular is used to create a single-page web application and the fetch function is ultilized to function with an external API. On the index page, there's a search box with auto-complete function that can render matching results in the drop-down and it renders character-by-character. The webpage is mobile responsive and compatible. 

## Usage

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

#### Remarks
The app utilises the free tier of Edamam API service, which limit to 10000 calls/month and 10 calls/minute. If the limit exceeds, the app may not be available to use.
